# Rust Practice Mashup

**What’s here:** A personal collection of practical exercises and code snippets I followed while learning Rust from scratch. Not a formal guide—just a “salad” of real-world examples and tutorials I worked through.

## About

This repository isn’t meant to teach you Rust in a linear fashion. Instead, it’s a living journal of code examples I used to build up my Rust skills-from zero to projects.
